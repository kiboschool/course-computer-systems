# Weeks 5 and 6 Participation

During the live class sessions this week and next, you will be asked to complete some of
the problems that we went through in this material.

Your completion of these questions and answers will make up your Weekly
Participation Score.

## Week 5

This week for your participation, we will be using a new tool that will ask you questions about a couple of different topics.

1. [Mid-point Course Reflection](https://app.sherpalabs.co/student/assignment/65c3bdaca08a82ee7191eeef) - Write a 1 paragraph summary of your experience in the course thus far this term.  You will then be asked additional questions about that experience.

2. [Use of the Stack Frame](https://app.sherpalabs.co/student/assignment/65c3bc3ca08a82ee7191eeec) - This will ask you some questions based on your reading this week.  

## Week 6

For the Week 6 participation score, your grade will be determined by the completion of the Sherpa Discussions associated with your reading assignment and by your live class attendance:

Read the following sections from [*Optimizing Software in C++: An optimization guide for Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms*](https://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf) by Ager Fog, Technical University of Denmark before proceeding.  I'll warn you that this is a good amount of reading, so I have included Sherpa links for you to complete after reading each section.  Completion of these Sherpa interviews and attendance during the live class session will make up your class participation grades for this week.
