# Processor Architecture and Optimization

Modern Central Processing Units (CPUs) have become powerhouses of processing capability, thanks to several key features that have been developed to enhance their performance. These features directly impact how software behaves and performs on current-generation systems. A few of these CPU features and how they can influence software performance follows:

- **Pipelining**: Pipelining in a CPU is a technique where multiple instruction stages (like fetching, decoding, executing) are overlapped and executed in parallel, significantly speeding up processing by handling different parts of multiple instructions simultaneously. This approach increases the instruction throughput, allowing the CPU to work on different stages of several instructions at once, much like an assembly line in a factory.

This video illustrates pipelining on the Intel x86 Haswell architecture.

- **Cache Hierarchies**: CPUs come with a multi-level cache system (L1, L2, L3) that stores frequently accessed data closer to the processor to reduce latency. A well-optimized cache hierarchy can greatly speed up data access times, improving overall software performance. The following video provides an overview of caches in modern processors.

- **Multi-core**: Modern CPUs have multiple cores (up to tens of cores), allowing them to perform several tasks simultaneously. This parallel processing capability can significantly boost performance for software that is designed to take advantage of multi-threading. Please watch the following 5 minute portion of this video discussing the evolution of multi-core processors in brief.

- **SIMD Instructions (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**: These are instructions that can perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously. SIMD can greatly accelerate tasks that involve processing large amounts of data, such as graphics rendering or scientific computations.

When software is optimized to utilize these features, it can run more efficiently, handle more tasks at once, and process data faster, leading to a smoother and more responsive user experience. 

Next we will provide a high-level view of a wide range of ways that you can try to optimize your code.  We will then delve into some of them more deeply, including how the processor architecture is relevant.
