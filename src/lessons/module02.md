# Machine-Level Representations Part 1

Welcome to week 2 of Computer Systems.  This week, we will continue learning about
the lowest levels of computer architecture, focusing primarily on Instruction
Set Architectures and x86-64 assembly.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to assembly language (x86-64 as an example)
- Data movement instructions
- Arithmetic and logical operations

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Understand the instruction set architecture (ISA) and its role in computer organization.
- Interpret and decode machine instructions.
- Explain the use of registers and memory addressing modes in machine-level programming.
- Perform simple arithmetic and logical operations using machine instructions.
