# Optimization

Each week's overview page should give students a preview of what they'll learn
that week, and frame the narrative of that section.

- Weekly overview video
- Narrative description of the week's topics
- List of topics

## Topics Covered

- Understanding modern processor architecture
- Capabilities of compilers and how they optimize
  - Loop unrolling
  - Reducing procedure calls
  - Eliminating memory references
- Profiling and use of profilers

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Identify performance bottlenecks in a program.
- Utilize performance analysis tools to measure and improve program efficiency.
- Apply optimization techniques like loop unrolling, software pipelining, and loop interchange.
- Understand the impact of memory access patterns on program performance.
