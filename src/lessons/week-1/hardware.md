# Hardware Organization of a System

## The von Neumann Architecture

The von Neumann architecture lays out the basic blueprint for constructing a functional computer system. It consists of four main subsystems: the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the control unit (CU), memory, and input/output (I/O) interfaces. All these are interconnected by a system bus and operate cohesively to execute programs.

TODO: Picture.

> Based on the description above, draw a diagram of the von Neumann architecture and label each component and its function.

## The Fetch-Execute Cycle

The fetch-execute cycle is the process by which a computer carries out instructions from a program. It involves fetching an instruction from memory, decoding it, executing it, and then repeating the process. This cycle is the heartbeat of a computer, underlying every operation it performs.
