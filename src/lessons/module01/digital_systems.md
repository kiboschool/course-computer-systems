# Digital Systems and Numbers

Now that we have introduced some of the basics of binary and integer representation, you should be well-prepared
to dive a bit deeper into why this is relevant in computer architecture.  

Please read Chapter 1 of the following material, which covers Digital Systems and Numbers.

Carpinelli, John D. (2023). [An Animated Introduction to Digital Logic Design](https://digitalcommons.njit.edu/oat/1/). NJIT Library.

After you have read this material, work through the exercises at the end of the chapter.  We will revisit some of
these during the live class session.
