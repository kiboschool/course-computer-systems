# Machine-Level Representations Part 2

This week, we are going to continue our exploration into how we represent various programming context at the assembly code and, thus, machine code level.  Throughout this module, we will provide many examples of C code along with equivalent representations in assembly code.  It is really important for all of these examples that you spend time reading through the examples carefully and understanding how the C code relates to the assembly code.  If you don't understand what a particular assembly code instruction is doing, look it up (use Google or even ChatGPT).  

## Topics Covered

- Control flow instructions
- Representing Procedures
- Arrays, Structures

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Implement loops and conditional statements at the machine level.
- Demonstrate how procedures are represented at the machine level, including parameter passing and return values.
- Access and manipulate arrays and structures in machine-level code.
