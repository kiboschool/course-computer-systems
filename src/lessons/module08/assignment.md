# Assignment 7: Virtual Memory

In this activity, you may work in pairs or individually.  **You may not use ChatGPT or similar tools in any way, shape,
or form on this activity. If there is any indication that one of those tools was used, you will received an automatic
zero.** Instead, working with your peer to do your best answering the questions throughout. Many of the questions are
are open-ended, and thus have many possible answers, so I would expect them to vary widely between submissions.

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able toâ€¦

- Demonstrate an understanding of the process of handling a page fault.
- Articulate the need for a page replacement algorithm in an operating system.
- Compute how many page faults occur for FIFO, OPT, LRU, and Working Set algorithms, for various inputs.
- Articulate the meaning of Beladyâ€™s Anomaly.

## Instructions

For this assignment, you will complete the worksheet linked below covering topics on System Calls and Processes.  You will make a copy of the worksheet and complete your work within your worksheet copy. Note that if you are working with a partner, you will only submit one copy of the worksheet between the two of you.  

As with the previous assignment, I encourage you to
spend some time thinking through these questions, working them out of paper (making notes and drawing pictures, where
necessary).  Though there are a lot of questions, no single question should take that much time.  If you have done your reading, and think through the models that are provided, you should be able to answer them relatively quickly.
