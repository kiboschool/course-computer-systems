# The Memory Hierarchy

This  module builds on the foundation laid in previous modules on processor architecture and program optimization. It explores memory technologies, such as SRAM and DRAM, non-volatile storage, and the principles of memory hierarchy, including the locality principle and cache operation. The module delves into the design and implementation of caches, addressing direct-mapped and associative caches, block size, cache conflicts, and write strategies. This module is crucial for understanding how efficient memory usage can significantly impact system performance.

## Topics Covered

- Technologies
- Locality
- Caches and Caching Strategies
- Writing cache-friendly Code

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Describe the different levels of the memory hierarchy and their characteristics.
- Analyze cache organization and mapping techniques (e.g., direct-mapped, set-associative, fully associative).
- Explain the principles of virtual memory and its role in address space management.
- Evaluate the trade-offs between memory hierarchy levels in terms of speed, capacity, and cost.
