## Participation

Active engagement in the Live Class sessions is critical for this course. Students should think of these sessions as
interactive engagements rather than lectures.  As such, you are expected to participate by answering questions,
completing the exercises, etc.

## Assignments

Most weeks you will be given an Assignment, where you'll practice the concepts covered in the readings and lessons.  The
assignments let you practice with the topics you covered that week, explore applications and connections, and check your
own understanding of the material.

Assignments will be distributed via GitHub classroom, and you will be asked to write significant code.  Upon completion
of the assignments, they will be submitted to Gradescope for grading.

## Projects

You will have a midterm project and a final project in this course.  Projects are larger in scale and will give you an
opportunity to work with larger amounts of code to solve more complex problems.  You will be given two weeks to complete
each project.  They represent a significant portion of your grade, and so it is important that you start these projects
as early as possible.  

## Late Policy

You are expected to submit your work by the deadline. Each assignment page will include instructions and a link to submit. 

The table above specifies the assignments for which late submission is possible. Any work submitted late will incur penalties in accordance with Kibo's [Late Work Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbax0XgKMoI58lOlTzJBzcZnUGodiqoOhvM4W9DFJ_M/preview#heading=h.c0d150s5aj8d).
