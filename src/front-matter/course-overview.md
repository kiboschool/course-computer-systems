# Course Overview

## Course Description

This course explores computing beyond software. Students will go a level deeper
to better understand the hardware, and see how computers are built and
programmed.  It is modeled on the popular project-based “Nand to Tetris”
textbook, which walks learners through building a computer from scratch.  It
aims to help students become better programmers by teaching the concepts
underlying all computer systems. The course integrates many of the topics
covered in other computer science courses, including algorithms, computer
architecture, operating systems, and software engineering.

Students will learn how to build a computer system using progressive steps.  The
course starts with a brief review of boolean algebra, and an introduction to
logic gates. Students design a set of elementary logic gates using a Hardware
Description Language. They then build chips to perform arithmetic and logical
operations, and build the computer’s main memory unit. Subsequently, students
learn to write low-level machine language, and build a CPU to create a fully
functional computer system. Finally, students implement a virtual machine,
compiler, and basic operating system.

By the end of the course, students  will develop a strong understanding of the
relationships between the architecture of computers and software that runs on
them.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Understand how hardware and software systems are built, and work together
- Explain how key abstraction layers in computers are implemented, and how
  higher level representations are translated into machine language
- Write assembler and machine code
- Design and build a general purpose computer system, including hardware and
  software, from the ground up
