# Live Classes

Each week, you will have a live class (see course overview for time). You are
required to attend the live class sessions.  

Video recordings and resources for the class will be posted after the classes
each week. If you have technical difficulties or are occasionally unable to
attend the live class, please be sure to watch the recording as quickly as
possible so that you do not fall behind.
