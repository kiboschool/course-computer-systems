# Course Overview

## Course Description

This course explores computing beyond software. Students will go a level deeper to better understand the hardware, and
see how computers are built and programmed.  It aims to help students become better programmers by teaching the concepts
underlying all computer systems. The course integrates many of the topics covered in other computer science courses,
including algorithms, computer architecture, operating systems, and software engineering.

In this course, students will explore the entire system including hardware, operating systems, compilers, and networks.
We will emphasize practical learning through the development and evaluation of real programs on actual machines. Key
topics covered include data representations, machine-level representations of C programs, processor architecture, and
program optimizations. Additionally, the course delves into the memory hierarchy, exceptional control flow (like
exceptions, interrupts, and Unix signals), virtual memory, system-level I/O, basic network programming, and concurrent
programming. These concepts are reinforced through engaging, hands-on assignments, providing a comprehensive
understanding of computer systems. By the end of the course, students  will develop a strong understanding of the
relationships between the architecture of computers and software that runs on them.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Understand how hardware and software systems are built, and work together
- Explain how key abstraction layers in computers are implemented, and how
  higher level representations are translated into machine language
- Write assembler and machine code
- Design and build a general purpose computer system, including hardware and
  software, from the ground up
