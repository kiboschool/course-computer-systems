# Processor Architecture

Each week's overview page should give students a preview of what they'll learn
that week, and frame the narrative of that section.

- Weekly overview video
- Narrative description of the week's topics
- List of topics

## Topics Covered

- Logic Gates and Design
- Sequential Execution
- Clocking
- Pipelining Overview

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Describe the major components of a CPU and their functions.
- Explain the concept of pipelining and its impact on processor performance.
- Analyze the use of caches and the principle of locality in memory hierarchy.
- Compare and contrast different CPU architectures (e.g., RISC vs. CISC).
