# Virtual Memory

In this module, we delve into the  world of Virtual Memory, a critical concept that builds upon our prior discussions on the Memory Hierarchy and Processes & Threads. Virtual memory serves as a bridge, offering a sophisticated way to manage system memory that provides the illusion of a large, contiguous memory space, while effectively utilizing physical memory. As we explore this  component, we will understand how it enables efficient, isolated, and concurrent execution of processes. By mastering virtual memory, you will gain deeper insights into system performance optimization and the mechanisms behind modern operating systems' memory management. This knowledge is fundamental for any aspiring computer scientist or engineer, providing the tools needed to design and troubleshoot advanced computing systems.

## Topics Covered

- Basics of Virtual memory
- Page Tables and Address Translation
- Paging and Page Replacement Algorithms
- Memory Management Unit (MMU)
- Performance and Optimization

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- explain the concepts and purposes of virtual memory, including how it extends the usable memory of a system and provides process isolation.
- construct and interpret page tables, and perform address translations between virtual and physical addresses.
- analyze and compare different paging systems and page replacement algorithms, understanding their implications on system performance.
- evaluate the performance of virtual memory systems and apply optimization techniques to reduce page faults, prevent thrashing, and improve overall efficiency.
