# Integer Representation and Arithmetic

## Binary Arithmetic: Performing Calculations in Base Two

Computers perform arithmetic operations using binary numbers. This section covers the binary representation of numbers, including both unsigned and signed integers, and explains binary arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction.

> Perform the binary addition of 1101 and 1011. What happens if there is an overflow?

## Representing Negative Numbers: Two’s Complement

To handle negative numbers, computers use a system called two’s complement. This method simplifies the process of binary subtraction and makes it more efficient for the computer to perform arithmetic with both positive and negative numbers.
