# Week 7 Participation

For your participation points this week, during class, you will provide status updates on each of your assignments and your midterm projects.  For work that is incomplete, you will identify blockers and decide upon next steps to ensure forward progress on your work.  

We will collect this information via a Gradescope submission, which will only be available during the class time.
